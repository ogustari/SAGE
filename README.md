# SAGE
All script used during my SAGE cours 2017

SequenceCut.sh cut the sequence of a fasta file between two given position (possible to insert until three different zone of cut).

SeqeunceMask.sh do the same of SeqeunceCut script but add an "X" on the initial and final cut position

ChangeSpacersName.sh allow to change all the header of the spacers and renamed it based on the file name.
